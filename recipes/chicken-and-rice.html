    <ol class="recipetext">
      <li>Pre-heat oven to 200c.</li>
      <li>(optional) cut any fatty or bloody bits off the chicken.</li>
      <li>Line a baking tray with foil, leaving enough excess to go over the chicken.</li>
      <li>Lightly spread olive oil onto the foil and season with the salt, pepper and aromat.</li>
      <li>Place the chicken onto the tray, leaving a small gap between each breast.</li>
      <li>Spread a small amount of olive oil onto the chicken and season generously.</li>
      <li>Wrap the foil over the seasoned chicken and seal the edges to create a foil pocket.</li>
      <li>Place the foil-wrapped chicken into the oven for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Take the chicken out of the oven and unwrap the foil. <strong>Be careful</strong> to avoid the steam that comes out of the foil as it will burn.</li>
      <li>Leave the chicken to cool slightly for 5-10 minutes</li>
      <li>Put the rice in the microwave, make sure to follow the instructions on the pakcet.</li>
      <li>As the rice cooks, cut the chicken into your preferred size/shape (We like to have 1cm thick <em>slices!</em>)</li>
      <li>Place your steaming rice onto the plate and top with your delicious chicken!</li>
