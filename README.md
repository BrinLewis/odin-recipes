# odin-recipes
Part of the Foundations course in the Odin Project. Putting newly-learned HTML knowledge to the test by creating a simple recipe website with multiple pages that all link to eachother.

By the end of the project I should have displayed skills such as using img elements to show images on my website, anchor elements both relative and absolute to link to other pages on the site and to other websites respectively and many text-related elements such as 'strong', 'em', 'p' and 'h1'-'h6'. I will also manually code my HTML boilerplate rather than using the '!' shortcut in VSCode to further cement my understanding of what a standard boilerplate consists of.
